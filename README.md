Code Quiz:

This quiz entails ten multiple-choice questions with a timer of 100 seconds. When a question is answered, it immediately goes to the next question. 

If a question is answered incorrectly, ten seconds is subtracted from the total time. 

The quiz ends when either all questions have been answered or the timer runs out. 

The scores can be saved to compare with your friends!
